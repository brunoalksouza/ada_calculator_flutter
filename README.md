# AFA EAAR Calculator

<p>
This is a project that was developed using Dart and Flutter.
<br>
This project was developed because of a friend of mine's pain with the project he has to do every time he wants to know what his media would be in the test for both institutions.<br>
<br>
I developed this application in a weekend alone
<br>
This solution makes it more practical and easier for him to calculate his grades.

## Prerequisites
<p>
Make sure you have Flutter, Dart, NODE, NPM and Git installed on your system.
</p>
<br>
<p>
You will also have to initialize the backend mentioned above before doing the step by step here.
</p>
<br>
<p>
It turns out that for you to be able to run it, you will need me to authorize your IP within the database, for that you can contact me.
